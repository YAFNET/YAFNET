YetAnotherForum.NET (YAF) INSTALLATION FILE

STEP 1. UNZIP

   Unzip the entire archive to to a folder you want to run YAF in on your web server.

STEP 2. SELECT WEB.CONFIG FILE

   If you are upgrading an existing YAF installation please be careful and follow
   a few precautions: ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE ATTEMPTING AN UPGRADE.
   
   IMPORTANT: UPGRADING YAF FORUMS v1.9.1.x and BELOW:

   You need to copy and rename the "/webconfigs/v191-upgrade-web.config" to "/web.config" as it
   contains necessary settings for the YAF membership providers to support backwards
   compatibility with your older YAF database. It's required that you merge these settings
   into your existing "web.config" file. If you need to do development with an 
   upgraded installation, please use "/webconfigs/dev-v191-upgrade-web.config".
   A tip to merge web.config files is to download both of them, then use a merge program to 
   combine. WinMerge is a free and excellent merge program which you can download
   here: http://www.winmerge.org/

   NEW INSTALLATION:

   If you are starting with a new installation, we recommend you start with
   "/webconfigs/recommended-web.config" and copy/rename it to "/web.config."
   The "/webconfigs/recommended-web.config" files contains better default
   ASP.NET security settings for a NEW installation of YAF.
   If you are doing development, use the "/webconfigs/dev-recommended-web.config"
   instead.
   Please Note: These web.config files will not work if you are upgrading from v1.9.1.x
   or below of YAF.

   Warning: DO NOT edit the web.config unless you know what you're doing.

STEP 3. SETUP DATABASE (IGNORE IF UPGRADE)

   A existing database needs to exist on your SQL Server with proper permissions
   set so that YAF can access it. When you run YAF for the first time it will 
   detect that the database is empty (or needs upgrading) and will automatically
   run you through the process required to create the SQL database structures
   needed.

STEP 4. MODIFY DB.CONFIG FILE:

   Modify the yafnet connectionString property to use your SQL Server database.
   The database must exist on the server with proper permissions, but it can be
   empty. Need help with your connection string? Visit this url:

   http://www.connectionstrings.com/default.aspx?carrier=sqlserver

   Look under the heading for "SqlConnection (.NET)" for example connection strings.

STEP 5. (OPTIONAL) MODIFY "app.config" FILE:

   By default YAF is designed to be installed at the root application on any
   IIS web server. If you want YAF to be installed off of the main root, you need
   to modify the root key. Make sure the files in the /bin directory of the YAF zip
   file are copied to /bin directory on the root of your web server.
   
   Then open up "app.config" and uncomment the "root" key. Enter the value as the
   directory to your forum.
   
   Example: If you have install the forum in the directory "/forum/yaf/"
   you will need to add key with name "root" and value "/forum/yaf/"
   to app.config.

   Also, in "app.config" you can modify the BoardID to use the board you want.
   If you only have one board or don't know what this is, leave it alone.   

STEP 6. (OPTIONAL) MODIFY "mail.config" FILE:

   Modify the smtp settings by entering your mail server information.

STEP 7. NEW INSTALLATION:

   Open the file <YAFroot>install/default.aspx on your web site. If you
   are testing on your local computer, under a directory called
   YetAnotherForum.Net, the address should be:
   http://localhost/yetanotherforum.net/install/

   Follow the installation wizard directions and you should be able to log
   in with the administration account you created during the setup.
   
   Give the ASPNET/Network Service account write access to the Upload
   folder.

STEP 7. UPGRADE:

   Open the file <YAFroot>install/default.aspx on your web site. If you
   are testing on your local computer, under a directory called
   YetAnotherForum.Net, the address should be:
   http://localhost/yetanotherforum.net/install/   
 
   The wizard will guide you through the upgrade process.
