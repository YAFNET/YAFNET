** TODO List Updated by Jaben Cargman 4/18/2005
**

- Auto-refreshing "last 10 posts" IFRAME in the post page serves to functions:
	1. allows users to view the current context of the conversion
	2. keeps the session from timing out

- Approved users don't have to be moderated

- Add message / header specific to groups or topics. e.g.: display 
  a message to all Guests encouraging them to register on the site.

- Popup notification for Personal Messages and an option in the Profile to disable it.

- Tooltips for user profile links (View profile).

- Show that there are messages to be moderated.

- Keep deleted posts for later purge. Option for moderators to tell why the post was deleted.

- Improve admin user editor: user stats, edit profile, edit password, edit banned/suspended status,
  and view IP access history.

- Language strings: tooltips for buttons (reply, quote, ...)

- Limit sigs to 5 lines or X characters. (Configurable in the backend.)

- Link correctly back to forum from install.

- Anonymous login (?)

- In the list of topics of a forum, can be showed a different image for topics with most activity
  then other (more than 10 or configurable numbers of posts).

- A fast response text box (only simple text with post button) at the bottom of 
  an open topic if the user can reply. So if I read a topic and want to reply 
  "on the fly" I can do it immediatly.

- Fix problems deleting posts with attachments.
