If you are upgrading from an earlier version, make sure you have a
backup of your existing database and files. At the minimum make sure
you don't overwrite your Web.config file. The existing Web.config
should work, but you might want to compare it with the new one and
see what has been added (or removed). After upgrading you should
open install/default.aspx and your database should be automatically
updated.

1. Unzip to a folder available from your web server.

2. Modify the Web.config file you just unzipped. You must modify
   connstr, basedir, themedir to valid values. The database pointed 
   to by connstr can be an already existing database, or you can 
   create a new database to install to.

3. If YetAnotherForum.net isn't installed at the root of your web
   server, make sure the files in the bin directory of the zip file
   is copied to /bin on your web server.

4. Open the file install/default.aspx on your webserver. If you are testing
   on your local computer, under a directory called forum, the 
   address should be http://localhost/forum/install/

5. Follow the directions and log in with the administration account
   you created during the setup.
