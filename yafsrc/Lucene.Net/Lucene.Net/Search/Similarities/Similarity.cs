    /// This is a low-level API, you should only extend this API if you want to implement
    /// an information retrieval <i>model</i>.  If you are instead looking for a convenient way
    /// to alter Lucene's scoring, consider extending a higher-level implementation
    /// such as <see cref="TFIDFSimilarity"/>, which implements the vector space model with this API, or
    /// just tweaking the default implementation: <see cref="DefaultSimilarity"/>.
    /// <para/>

    /// <a name="indextime"/>
    /// At indexing time, the indexer calls <see cref="ComputeNorm(FieldInvertState)"/>, allowing
    /// the <see cref="Similarity"/> implementation to set a per-document value for the field that will
    /// be later accessible via <see cref="Index.AtomicReader.GetNormValues(string)"/>.  Lucene makes no assumption
    /// about what is in this norm, but it is most useful for encoding length normalization
    /// information.
    /// <para/>
    /// Implementations should carefully consider how the normalization is encoded: while
    /// Lucene's classical <see cref="TFIDFSimilarity"/> encodes a combination of index-time boost
    /// and length normalization information with <see cref="Util.SmallSingle"/> into a single byte, this
    /// might not be suitable for all purposes.
    /// <para/>
    /// Many formulas require the use of average document length, which can be computed via a
    /// combination of <see cref="CollectionStatistics.SumTotalTermFreq"/> and
    /// <see cref="CollectionStatistics.MaxDoc"/> or <see cref="CollectionStatistics.DocCount"/>,
    /// depending upon whether the average should reflect field sparsity.

    /// Finally, using index-time boosts (either via folding into the normalization byte or
    /// via <see cref="Index.DocValues"/>), is an inefficient way to boost the scores of different fields if the
    /// boost will be the same for every document, instead the Similarity can simply take a constant
