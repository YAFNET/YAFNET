    /// constructors, to customize when older
    /// point-in-time commits (<see cref="IndexCommit"/>)
    /// are deleted from the index directory.  The default deletion policy

    ///
    /// <para>One expected use case for this (and the reason why it

    /// that Lucene's "point in time" search normally relies on.
    /// By implementing a custom deletion policy, such as "a
    /// commit is only removed once it has been stale for more
    /// than X minutes", you can give your readers time to
    /// refresh to the new commit before <see cref="IndexWriter"/>
    /// removes the old commits.  Note that doing so will
    /// increase the storage requirements of the index.  See <a
