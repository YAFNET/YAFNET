Analyzer for Chinese, which indexes unigrams (individual chinese characters).

 Three analyzers are provided for Chinese, each of which treats Chinese text in a different way.

* StandardAnalyzer: Index unigrams (individual Chinese characters) as a token.
* CJKAnalyzer (in the Lucene.Net.Analysis.Cjk namespace): Index bigrams (overlapping groups of two adjacent Chinese characters) as tokens.
* SmartChineseAnalyzer (in the Lucene.Net.Analysis.SmartCn package): Index words (attempt to segment Chinese text into words) as tokens.


Example phrase： "我是中国人"

1. StandardAnalyzer: 我－是－中－国－人
2. CJKAnalyzer: 我是－是中－中国－国人
3. SmartChineseAnalyzer: 我－是－中国－人
