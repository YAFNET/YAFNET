    ///// <summary>
    ///// This is the rev 502 of the Snowball SVN trunk,
    ///// but modified:
    ///// made abstract and introduced abstract method stem to avoid expensive reflection in filter class.
    ///// refactored StringBuffers to StringBuilder
    ///// uses char[] as buffer instead of StringBuffer/StringBuilder
    ///// eq_s,eq_s_b,insert,replace_s take CharSequence like eq_v and eq_v_b
    ///// reflection calls (Lovins, etc) use EMPTY_ARGS/EMPTY_PARAMS
    ///// </summary>

    // LUCENENET specific: Changed the implementation to be more like the original implementation at
    // https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball/commit/a823d24f1b6efd693dcce3119bdcea54855663a0
    // to avoid expensive Reflection calls.
